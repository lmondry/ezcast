<!--
This popup appears when the user clicks on "move this record".
It presents the user with a list of albums he can move the asset to.

You should not have to use this template on its own. however, if you do, please
make sure $created_albums_with_descriptions is initialized and is an array containing the album names (without any suffix) as keys, and albums descriptions as values
for every album the user can create.
